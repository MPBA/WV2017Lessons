# Python in a Notebook #

This repository contains a curated collection of Jupyter/IPython Notebooks of 
introductory materials about programming in Python.

## Goals ##

Available notebooks are intended to aid both students and teachers in learning and teaching 
Python programming, respectively. 

In more details, the goals of this project are:

- Introduce students as quickly as possible to the basics of Python programming;
- Introduce best practice as early as possible, while remaining accessible to students with no background in programming at all;
- Provide teachers an easy-to-use material about programming in Python to be used in their lectures

## Running Notebooks ##

All you need to do to play notebooks is to open a Terminal, and type the following command:

    jupyter notebook
    

**That's it!** :)

## Programming Environment

These notebooks are written primarily in **Python 3**. 

If the default Python on your system is Python 3, then you will have a simpler time contributing to the project. 
If you only have Python 2, you might want to consider adding Python 3 to your system. 

In this regards, you may find useful to take a look at the *Programming Environment* [notebook]() where you 
could find links and details on how to set up your environment depending on your platform.

### Requirements ###

* Python 3.x (2.x would work as well)
* IPython 4.x (with **notebook support**) or Jupyter: 
    * `pip install ipython[notebook]` (OR)
    * `pip install jupyter`
