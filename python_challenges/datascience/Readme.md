# Python Data Science challenges

These challenges are aimed at people who've already learned the basics of
Python and want to dive into the set of Python libraries and modules for Computational Science.  

The set of challenges you will find in this section will provide an introduction to some of the most
popular and fundamental tools in the Python ecosystem for data processing and 
[machine learning](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html). 


# Notebook Format

Differently from other sections, Data Science Challenges will be provided as **Jupyter Notebooks**.
If you don't know what a Jupyter notebook is, or how to use it, please take a look at this quick 
introductory tour: [IPython Notebook Beginner Guide](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

For additional details and materials on Jupyter and IPython, I suggest this 
[Jupyter Notebook the Definitive Guide](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook):

- [What is a Jupyter Notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook#WhatIs)

# Python Data Science challenges in this repo

[Numpy Arrays](numpy_arrays.ipynb)  - learn how to create and use numpy `ndarrays`: the most fundamental structure of data processing

[Scipy Sparse](scipy_sparse.ipynb) - dive into the `scipy.sparse` module for sparse matrix implementations.

[Pandas DataFrame](pandas_dataframe.ipynb) - learn how to load and manipulate data using pandas `DataFrame` and `Series`

[Basic Data Viz](data_visualisation.ipynb) - basic introduction to data visualization using `matplotlib` and `bokeh`

[Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit-learn](scikit-learn_machine-learning.ipynb) - learn the basics of machine learning using scikit-learn

# References and Materials

If you want an introductory overview of Python for Data Science, I strongly recommend  
[Scipy Lecture Notes](http://www.scipy-lectures.org): a community driven project where you can find
tutorials (for non-experts) on the scientific Python ecosystems.
