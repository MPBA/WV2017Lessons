    "# Introducing Scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several Python libraries which provide solid implementations of a range of machine learning algorithms. One of the best known is scikit-learn, a package which provides efficient versions of a large number of common algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn is characterized by a clean, uniform, and streamlined API, as well as by very useful and complete online documentation. A benefit of this uniformity is that once you under‚Äê stand the basic use and syntax of scikit-learn for one type of model, switching to a new model or algorithm is very straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides an overview of the API of scikit-learn; a solid understanding of these API elements will form the foundation for understanding the deeper practical discussion of machine learning algorithms and approaches.\n",
