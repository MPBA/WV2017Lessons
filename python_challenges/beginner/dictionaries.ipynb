    "## DICTIONARIES\n",
    "A dictionary is like a list, but more general. In a list, the indices have to be integers; in a dictionary they can be \n",
    "(almost) any type. You can think of a dictionary as a mapping between a set of indices (which are called keys) and a set\n",
    "of values. Each key maps to a value. The association of a key and a value is called a key-value pair or sometimes an \n",
    "item.\n",
    "As an example, we’ll build a dictionary that maps from English to Spanish words, so the keys and the values are all \n",
    "strings.\n",
    "The function dict creates a new dictionary with no items. Because dict is the name of a built-in function, you should \n",
    "avoid using it as a variable name.\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> eng2sp = dict()\n",
    ">>> print(eng2sp)\n",
    "{}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The squiggly-brackets, {}, represent an empty dictionary. To add items to the dictionary, you can use square brackets:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> eng2sp['one'] = 'uno'\n",
    "```\n",
    "This line creates an item that maps from the key ’one’ to the value 'uno'. If we print the dictionary again, we see a \n",
    "key-value pair with a colon between the key and value:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print(eng2sp)\n",
    "{'one': 'uno'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This output format is also an input format. For example, you can create a new dictionary with three items:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> eng2sp = {'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three': 'tres'} \n",
    "```\n",
    "But if you print eng2sp, you might be surprised:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(eng2sp)\n",
    "{'one': 'uno', 'three': 'tres', 'two': 'dos'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The order of the key-value pairs is not the same. In fact, if you type the same example on your computer, you might get\n",
    "a different result. In general, the order of items in a dictionary is unpredictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that’s not a problem because the elements of a dictionary are never indexed with integer indices. Instead, you use \n",
    "the keys to look up the corresponding values:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print(eng2sp['two'])\n",
    "dos\n",
    "```\n",
    "The key ’two’ always maps to the value 'dos' so the order of the items doesn’t matter. If the key isn’t in the \n",
    "dictionary, you get an exception:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print(eng2sp['four'])\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "KeyError: 'four'\n",
    "```"
