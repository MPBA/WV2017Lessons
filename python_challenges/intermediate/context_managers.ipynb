    "Let's take our decorators challenge from earlier, and say\n",
    "we want to implement a lock.  Say we're running lots\n",
    "of my_programs in parallel, and you want to restrict\n",
    "some functions to only being called once at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we use a tempfile to hold the lock:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def hold_lock():\n",
    "    filename = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False).name\n",
    "    with open(filename, 'w') as f:\n",

    "\n",
    "So we want to run \"hold_lock\" before each function starts, and\n",
    "\"release_lock\" at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you could use a decorator, but what if the function\n",
    "raises an exception?  now you have to have a try/except\n",
    "and it gets yucky...\n",

    "You might want to try this to get a feel for the ugliness.\n",

    "But a context manager would be much nicer!\n",

    "Find out how to write a context manager that calls hold_lock\n",
    "before a function runs, and calls release_lock at the end,\n",
    "even if the function raises an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "For bonus points:  make it so that the user can also write\n",
    "to the lock file, for debugging purposes, when they're\n",
