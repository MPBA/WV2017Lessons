    "\n",
    "- [The Python website](http://python.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "    The main Python website is probably not of too much interest to you at this point, but it is a great resource to know about as you start to learn more.\n",

    "<!-- -->\n",
    "\n",
    "- [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Python Conference (PyCon) is an incredible event, and the community is entirely welcoming to new programmers. They happen all over the world, throughout the year. If you can make your way to one of these conferences, you will learn a great deal and meet some really interesting people.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- [PyCon Italia](http://pycon.it)\n",
    "\n",
    "    PyCon Italia is the Italian Python conference where professionals, researchers and lovers of the most beautiful programming language, gather together.\n",

    "- [PyLadies](http://www.pyladies.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Women and minorities are still under-represented in most technology fields, and the programming world is no different in this regard. That said, the Python community may well be the most welcoming and supportive programming community for women and minorities. There are a number of groups dedicated to bringing women and minorities together around programming in Python, and there are a number of explicit Codes of Conduct for Python-related events.\n",
    "\n",
    "    PyLadies is one of the most visible of these organizations. They are a great resource, so go see what they do and what they have to offer.\n",

    "    \n",
    "- [Python User Groups](https://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Wherever there are a number of Python programmers, they will find a way to get together. Python user groups are regular meetings of Python users from a local area. Go take a look at the list of user groups, and see if there is one near you."
